for my homework #3

when starting this homework after reading the read me the first thing i knew i had to do was make arrays for the uppercase,lowercase,numbers, and special symbols

after that i thought now how will i select them so i thought up i will make an empty array to put the selected arrays into so need a way to prompt the user to choose which arrays they wanted in the password gen.

once they select what they want i then needed a way to have it randomlly selct one of the arrays to use then have another randomizer choose something form the chosen array and needed it to loop as many time as the user needed there password to be

i had to then come up with a way to limit the amount of charcters it could be from 8-128, but an issue i ran into was because i had now put the user input into a function it was unable to be used by the rest of the code so i had to come up with a way to push the users input somewhere the rest of the code could git it.

after solving that issue i had to connect the code to the button in the html code so that when the button is clicked the function will run .

then i needed to find a way to print the password out into text for it to be viewable by the user

this ended up nolonger being relevent because it didnt work because of my own mistake.
<!-- one thing i could not get to work and i couldnt figure out why is that when it came to the selectors i wanted the process of slecting what types of charcters the password will contain, if nothing was selected i wanted it to loop around informing the user that at least one must atleast be selected but it would just get stuck and not loop.   -->
